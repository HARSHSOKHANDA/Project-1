          <h2>Shaheed Bhagat Singh</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian
            anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who participated in the mistaken
            murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in
            what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian
            nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of
            the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in
            jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned
            newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region,
            and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in
            Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7]
            the charismatic Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in
            the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian
            National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign
            for India's independence.
